# pars-an-article-in-cs
Write a program in the C# programming language that reads in a text file can have a text intake and performs the following operations:
1. Count the number of lines, words, and characters in the file. The program should output the results in a formatted string.

2. Find the longest and shortest words in the file. The program should output both the word and its length.
3. Compute the frequency of each word and output the top N most frequent words, where N is a configurable parameter. The program should output the words and their frequency in descending order.

4. Identify and output all palindromic words (words that are spelled the same backward and forwards).

5. Identify and output all pairs of words that appear consecutively in the file with a frequency greater than a configurable threshold. The program should output both the pair of words and their frequency and the threshold must be defined by the user.
